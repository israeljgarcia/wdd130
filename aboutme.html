        <p><img src="images/Flag_of_Arizona.svg"></p>
        <p>I am from Phoenix, Arizona and I live with my parents and two siblings. I am the oldest of 3 and I will be getting married in March. <br>
        I am majoring in Computer Information Technology and I am really excited to be at BYUI.
        </p>
        <p>I did not serve a mission.</p>
        <p>For my career I would like to become a software developer or web developer, so that I can start my own software company in the future.</p>
        <p>This is an image of me with my siblings. <br> <img src="images/me-and-my-siblings.jpg"></p>
