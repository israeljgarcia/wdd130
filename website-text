            <h2>We Run Rivers to Relax.</h2>
            <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. 
                That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating.<br> 
                Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

            <h2>We Run Whitewater for the Rush.</h2>
            <p>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. 
                We believe that that tenseness that comes when <br> you are looking down the tongue
                of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always 
                follows <br> even more.</p>

                best suits you. We're waiting to hear from you!</p>
