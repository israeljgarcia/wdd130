Purpose
It has always been my dream to have my own technology company.
The purpose of this website is to inform people about my tech 
company called Pye Squared. Pye Squared focuses on software 
products that are catered to user experience. Simple UI enables 
users to learn to use a software quickly. Although the UI is simple, our 
software's functionality is complex allowing users to have 
a powerful, but easy to use application. 

This website showcases our current projects, company goals,
and how to contact us.

Target Audience 
My target audience for this website is small/medium sized 
businesses that need small/medium sized web applications 
to be built for them. This will target businesses that need 
to move their services online. This will also target individuals
who need a web presense to get their business off the ground.
I am mainly targetting clients who need to provide an online service.
