      <h2 class="rivers-headline2">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
      <div class="rivers-left-image1">

      </div>

      <p class="rivers-paragraph2">
        Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
        Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of
        No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks
        that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the
        river that they never left. Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides
        around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted.
        The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which
        tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from
        sun or rain when needed. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from
        class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the
        United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and
        colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late
        summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children
        who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
        water more.

      <h2 class="rivers-headline3">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
      <div class="rivers-right-image1">

      </div>

      <p class="rivers-paragraph3">
        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate
        land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river
        and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great
        rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand
        Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
        outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of
        prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater
        opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in
        6 days Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.
        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
        canyon tells.

      <h2 class="rivers-headline4">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
      <div class="rivers-left-image2">

      <p class="rivers-paragraph4">
        This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river
        trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand
        Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking
        scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is
        filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side
        canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. CLASS I - X:
        The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the
        Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide
        variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar
        with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
