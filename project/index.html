            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Heading Font: Source Code Pro</h4>
            <p>I want to choose this font for the heading because it looks more formal and professional, <br>
            but it still fits my theme.</p>
            <h4>Paragraph Font: Indie Flower</h4>
            <p>I chose this font because it is playful and it is attractive to read <br>
            unlike Times New Roman which makes me think of essays.</p>
            <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
            <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and
                Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
                Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
            <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
            <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and
                experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company
                can make it happen for you.</p>
