            <p>I am from Phoenix, Arizona and I live with my parents and two siblings. 
            I am the oldest of 3 and I will be getting married in March.
            I am majoring in Applied Technology and I am really excited to be at BYUI.
            </p>
            <p>For my career I would like to become a software developer or web developer, so that I can start my own software company in the future.</p>
            <p>This is an image of me with my siblings.
